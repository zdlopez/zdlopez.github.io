Today, we banged out some good progress on our group project.  We were able to finalize some first iterations on data structure and overall design and uses.  

It was a very good day.

Highlights of the day:

* Google Maps API
* Mongo DB/Mongoose

<!--more-->

### Google Maps API

More work with the API.  Playing with drawing lines on the map and mostly working with the data object.  

### Mongo DB/Mongoose

I took on the taks of mapping the geoJSON object into a schema for use in our Mongo database.  I was able to get this done over the course of the day and it really solidified my confidence in working with databases.  It was so satisfying getting data written to the db and having it store properly.
