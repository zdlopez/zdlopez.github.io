title: Hack Reactor - Week 5 Day 4
tags: [Hack Reactor, Mongo, Mongoose, Azure]
---

What is up with [Microsoft Azure](azure.microsoft.com)?  It seems to be pretty good, if not a little finnicky.  

Anyhow, today we were trying to set up a [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/) instance and for whatever reason the transaction wouldn't go through.  This prevented [Alan](http://www.arraysofsun.com) from getting through the deployment part of the sprint.

Highlights of the day:

* Mongo DB
* Mongoose
* Hackathon #2

### Mongo

[Mongo DB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a "No SQL" database that is quite popular.  No SQL means it is not structured and is a document store database.  This is not a relational database.  The syntax is just a little bit different than SQL.  It does have a nice feature in that the data is stored in what amounts to [JSON](http://www.json.org/).  JSON is a way to store objects and is very useful and usable in Javascript.  

### Mongoose

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is a sort of middle ware that provides schema syntax for Mongo DB.  This makes for an easier transition between SQL databases and Mongo.  It took a bit for us to figure out the syntax and the mental model of Mongoose.  Once we did we cruised right through the database migration and it made Mongo easy to use.

I'm looking forward to using both Mongo and Mongoose in the future.

### Hackathon #2

Participated in my second hackathon tonight.  I was on a team with [Neil Lokare](http://www.neillokare.com/), [Bren Cubacub](https://github.com/bcbcb), and [Matt Conrad](https://github.com/mmconrad).  

The prompt was to build or break a video game in two hours.  As a group, we landed on 3D multiplayer pong.  This required us to use/learn [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and [sockets.io](http://socket.io/).  

We were able to grab a game and modify it, get it up onto a server, and get data going back forth. We weren't quite able to get the product final as we needed to get the second camera render going.  This was super interesting and amazing to see what we could get to in 2 hours.
