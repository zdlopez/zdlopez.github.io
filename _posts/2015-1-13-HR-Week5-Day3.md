title: Hack Reactor - Week 5 Day 3
tags: [Hack Reactor, Grunt, Azure]

Another new sprint started today with [Alan Sun](www.arraysofsun.com).  We are working on deployment of a previous sprint to Azure.  Things seem pretty straight forward as we have a lot done so far.  Tomorrow we will be swapping in Mongo as the database.

Highlights of the day:

### Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is the the big news today.  This software is a task runner that can automate a majority of the tasks associated with software development.  In simple terms, when code is changed, many things have to be updated:  rerun the server, retest the code, reminify the code, redeploy to the remote server.  All of these things take time.

Grunt can save you this time, by allowing you to specify what happens when.  Your script can then be called with various options based on what you want done.  See this [site](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/) for some samples.  

I'm excited to use this further as we move into the project period.
