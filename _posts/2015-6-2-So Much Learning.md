title: So Much Learning
tags: [Career, Job, Impostor Syndrome]

It's a been a touch over 6 weeks since I started at [Fivestars](http://www.fivestars.com) and I wanted to provide an update on how things are going.  

Holy crap there are so many things to learn!

I felt super prepared by Hack Reactor, but there is just so much to get acclimated to in a real working environment.  

After a few days of setting up my computer, I then spent the next week learning Python, reading tutorials, and trying to figure out the code base.  I will say that in this period, the dreaded Impostor Syndrome reared its ugly head yet again.

The sheer volume of materials to read and try to comprehend was daunting and overwhelming.  At many different points, I had to just focus on what I did know and stay strong in my belief that I would figure it out.  

Just as a non-exhaustive sample of the things I have learned, or at least figure out how to work with, see the following:

* Python
* Django
* TastyPie
* Phabricator
* Private Git Repositories
* Git Submodules
* Restangular
* NgMock
* Jenkins
* OpsGenie
* Redis
* Celery

I guess I write this today, to remind myself and others that this is the job.  Figuring out new things, integrating different technologies, and working on issues that maybe weren't issues just yesterday.

The other thing I want to remind myself of is that I do love it and I am so glad for the change.  

Anyhow looking forward to getting back to writing a little more regularly here.  Be on the lookout for updates.
