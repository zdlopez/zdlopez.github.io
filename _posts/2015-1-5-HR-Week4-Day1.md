title: Hack Reactor - Week 4 Day 1
tags: [Hack Reactor, Backbone, Node]

And just like that we are a quarter of the way through Hack Reactor.  I've already learned so much and it's showing no signs of slowing down.

Highlights of the day:

* Backbone
* Node

### Backbone

I gotta work on this more.  We had a self-assesment today, and I couldn't get my mind out of Backbone written in Coffeescript.  Backbone makes sense in my head.  Just got to practice the syntax a bit more.  Read through a few examples.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is a backend server system written in Javascript.  It provides asychronous event handling making it an excellent choice for app back ends.  My pair, Neil Lokare, and I have hammered through most of the requirements for the two day sprint, today.  It helps to have a good mental model of how internet browser requests work.  

Tomorrow, we will be refactoring and making this thing a bit cooler.  I'll be posting this project when finished.  Very fun. 

So far, I really like node.  It makes sense to me.
