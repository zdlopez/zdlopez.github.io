## Happy New Year!

Another day off and we were back at it today full bore.  

Highlights of the day:

### Presentation of Affordable Housing

Today I gave my lightning talk on Affordable Housing.  The link is here should you want to check out my deck:

### Coffee Script

[Coffee Script](http://coffeescript.org/) is programming language that compiles into Javascript.  The syntax is very different, but is very clearly shorter.  We just started to use it today and we using it to build a Backbone application.  

Here is some sample Javascript:

```javascript
var example = function(a, b){
  return a + b;
}
```

And the same code in Coffeescript

```coffeescript
example = (a, b)->
  a + b
```

This is just a small subset of what's possible.  Very interesting.  I'll have to see how I like it as I use it more, but so far so good.
