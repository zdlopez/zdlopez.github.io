I still kinda can't believe that today is graduation.  It is the last day of the 12 weeks.  I am happy and proud of my cohort.  I can't wait to see which companies we all end up.

I have zero regrets about this journey.  If you are on the fence about Hack Reactor, I would say do it.  I can't recommend it more highly.

Here's to graduation and all the new adventures to come.
