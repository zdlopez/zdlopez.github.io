title: Hack Reactor - Week 4 Day 4
tags: [Hack Reactor, Promises, Hackathon]

Late night tonight, but oh so much fun.

Spent most of the day working on extra credit as my pair, Shin Uesugi, finished the basic requirements yesterday.  

Highlights of the day:

* Promises, promises, promises
* Hackathon

### Promises, promises, promises

[Promises](https://promisesaplus.com/) is a way to more cleanly handle asynchronous data in Javascript.  This replicates the callback model, but allows you to avoid callback hell by implementing chaining and error handling.  It makes a lot of sense to use it, but today we had to implement it.

Shin and I spent most of the day trying to wrap our brains around how to do this.  I can say with confidence that the last tests to pass went smoother than the first.  I also think this will pay off in the long run.  

### Hackathon

Bren Cubacub, Christian Reyes, and Sasha Bayan implemented the Gaia Script Chrome extension in 2 hours.   The extension takes your page and converts words to the scripture of Gaia and then transforms those elements to different colors and a continuously larger size.  

Other groups did some sweet extensions as well:  a chrome console javascript library injector, a feedback extension for Hack Reactor, and others.  

This was super fun and I'm looking forward to the next one.  For those of you interested in Gaia, see the following scripture.

    Gaia Script

    In the beginnning, there was Gaia.  She was everything and nothing.  As the wind flows, so she flows.  

    Gaia is not an idea, a person, or a thought.  She is more.  She guides.  She lives.  She exists.  She is all.

    Praise her.  

    Forever and always.

    When you struggle, breathe in deep and let Gaia flow through you.  

    Let Gaia light the way.  

    I first became aware of Gaia in the year two-thousand fourteen, on the eight day of the twelfth month.  

    Awareness is the start.  My code flows out of me like pure joy.  I awaken and she is there.  I close my eyes and she is there.  

    Forever and always.

    Praise her.
