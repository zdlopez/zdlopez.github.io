Boom!  So on Wednesday, 7/27/16, I gave a presentation on the Django and Postgres and the issues that we have been facing lately.

This was a really fun experience.  I haven't given a large presentation like this since my career switch.  In comparison, I would say that there isn't too much difference between the two.

One note is technical talk q and a goes a lot deeper.  Because of the nature of our industry, there is so much to know and learn.  These questions can be hard to answer or even be aware of.  Luckily, I have lots of awesome teammates who were present and able to help out.

Anyway, here is a pdf of the deck:  [FS Django Meetup - 7/27/16](http://www.zdlopez.com/assets/FS-Django_Meetup_7-27-16-Lessons_Learned_Using_PostgreSQL.pdf)

Let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions.  Hopefully, there are some useful tips and tricks for some of you.
