When you are applying for jobs two weeks can feel both like a very long time and a very short time.  One thing I have to keep reminding myself of is that the hiring process can take a while on the other side of the table.  In my former career, a fast hire would be a month at best.  Because of this, I can't stress out over when a company gets back to me or when I will finally secure employment.  

This whole period feels very different.  It is like Hack Reactor was this nurturing protective bubble around all of us.  Now we are in the real world and have to deal with real things.  Don't get me wrong, Hack Reactor is actually super supportive in this period.  The main difference is that the daily schedule you make is completely your own and this feels strange after so much structure.

Overall, I am really excited about our prospects.  Some folks have already received and accepted offers and that's just plain amazing.  I am looking forward to the finishing out this journey on a positive note.  I will keep you all updated.
