Tomorrow, I walk into Hack Reactor as a senior.  This is just plain madness.

Just 6 weeks (really 8 with breaks), I was just starting my journey into the land of Javascript.

Now me and my cohort will be considered seniors.  We have the experience to actually talk to and advise others at this point, and we will need to.

This is amazing.

It is hard to believe, but I do very much believe.  I have enjoyed this first 6 weeks, and I feel more confident than ever.  I know that Hack Reactor was the right choice for me and I am so happy that I am here.

I look forward to this project period and demonstrating what I have learned.
