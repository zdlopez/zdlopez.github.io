Hey folks, it's been about a month since I last wrote.  This has been one crazy period.  The final thesis project is a grueling, amazing, wonderful experience.  For the last month, up until yesterday, my group, [Eric Benson](https://github.com/ericbenson), [Sasha Bayan](https://github.com/SashaBayan) and I, have spent each and every day working on [Q-Rad.io](http://Q-Rad.io).  

##[Q-Rad.io](http://Q-Rad.io)

Q-Rad.io is a rapid music discovery engine powered by Machine Learning.  I would love it, if you checked it out and let me know what you think.  As a group, we are planning on continuing development on this project.  It has been a great learning experience and it's actually a product that we all enjoy using.

##Hiring day

Hiring day is the day when all the [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com) partner companies come in, watch each group present their final projects, and then do speed date interviews with between 5 to 10 students.  

What a freaking amazing energizing day!  First of all, Hack Reactor staff do so much to help us prepare for this day.  We practice our presentations, give each other feedback, write and rewrite our resumes, do mock interviews, practice whiteboarding, and the list goes on and on...

Every team killed it.  Every project looked good and was presented well.  I am so proud of both cohorts (22 and 23).  Then we banged out 10 min rapid interviews companies.  This was just plain fun!  I love how the rapid style allows you to get in interview mode.  I feel super prepared to head into my job seach now.  Hack Reactor gives you the tools.  Now I just gotta execute.  

##The Last Days

This week and this program is quickly coming to a close.  Now that Hiring Day is done, all of the seniors are reminiscing on the time here.  We are enjoying the last few moments with each other and preparing to move forward with that job hunt.  

I can't wait to see where everyone ends up.  We are amazing and this is just the start.  

##My Resume

May as well pitch here too.  Here is my [resume](/assets/Zachary Lopez.pdf).  I am looking for a full stack software engineering role.  My main requirement is that I would be working with people that are passionate about the company/product and that the product is providing efficiency to people.  I want to solve problems and use software to make an impact on people.  Feel free to reach out to me if you know of anything.
