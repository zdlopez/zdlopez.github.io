Welp, there goes another 7 months posts.  That sucks!  

# Updates

At work, I feel really great!  I'm confident in what I am doing and I'm able to that impact each and every day.  Very recently, I've been doing a ton of work on optimizing our database performance.  It's been fun looking at queries and figuring out a better way to get the data we need.  I'll need to do a more formal and detailed post as this progresses.

Also, I've been doing a lot of cross departmental work and I've really enjoyed this.  Helping people understand what we do in engineering and applying our engineering talent to help them has been amazing and invigorating.  Nothing quite like people feeling more connected and appreciating what you do.  Yay!

# Moving Forward

Going forward, I definitely want to write more.  I think it helps me understand things better, if I can clearly explain it in writing.  To that end, I am going to try the following types of posts:

* Things I learned
* Things I'm reading
* Useful things I've worked on that might help others

And so I guess here we go...

# The things I'm reading

* [Microservices at Box](https://www.box.com/blog/kubernetes-box-microservices-maximum-velocity/)
* [Planet scale engineering at Google](http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/7/18/how-does-google-do-planet-scale-engineering-for-a-planet-sca.html)
