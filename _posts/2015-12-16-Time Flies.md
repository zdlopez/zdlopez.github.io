It's been a minute...or two...or several months.  Finding time to write is hard, or rather finding a way not to write is pretty easy.  These last few months have been a whirlwind.  Dealt with passing of my father due to cancer (fuck you, cancer!) and then have just dived into work and being a better engineer.

I guess this post will be an update and a committment to get back on the train and update this site more as head into 2016.

# Work Update

I have been at [FiveStars](http://www.fivestars.com) for almost 8 months now.  In that time, I have the had the honor of working with a great team.  Every day, we laugh and have a great time and get a ton done.  Some of the things I've done, helped with, or learned about:

* implemented a write-thru cache for a resource that created database contention and slowdown
* helped with a read cache for an intensive sql query
* learned how to use AWS, Loggly, New Relic, Sentry, OpsGenie to diagnose site issues
* helped build out our front-end for scheduling promotions
* tons of reading on site performance, db performance

# The things I'm reading
