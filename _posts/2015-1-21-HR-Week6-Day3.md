title: Hack Reactor - Week 6 Day 3
tags: [Hack Reactor, Google Maps]

Today was all about the start of group projects.  We were broken into groups of between 3 and 4 for this next phase.  

I have been put in an awesome group with [Andy Coenen](http://cannoneyed.github.io/), [Benoy Maniara](https://github.com/maniarab), and [Kiran Rao](https://github.com/kranrao).

We've gotten off to a great start with a cool idea and some great first steps.

I can't wait to see where we land and share more.

Highlights of the day:

* Google Maps API
* Project Group Energy

### Google Maps API

The [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) is amazing.  In just playing with it for an hour tonight, I can already see that awesome things are possible.

### Project Group Energy

It was a lot of fun to see how high energy the groups were.  I think a lot of us have been waiting for this project period to start.  

The freedom of the projects is exciting, but also a little scary.  There is no real net and it is up to you and the group to stay accountable and get things done.
