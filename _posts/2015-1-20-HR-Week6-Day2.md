title: Hack Reactor - Week 6 Day 2
tags: [Hack Reactor, Three.js]

What a crazy day.  Went to bed around 1, woke up around 6.  Kept on coding to hit my MVP.

Highlights of the day:

* Three.js
* Cohort MVPs

### Three.js

I was able to get collision detection working.  Overall, I think I had somewhere near 500 lines of code.  In remembering doing graphics before, this would have been easily 5 times the lines of code without the three.js library.  

There is not a ton of documentation out there.  I learned the most from examples of source code doing various things.  

I was able to implement collision detection, multiple cameras, and a first-person view camera all in the browser.  

### Cohort MVPs

Just a ton of cool stuff.  Everyone had great projects that were interesting or definitely demonstrated the power of the technology.  

I enjoyed the rapid 60 second presentations.  The work really had to speak for itself.  There wasn't enough time to explain things away, the truth was on the screen.

I loved it.

Tomorrow we start group (4 person) projects.
