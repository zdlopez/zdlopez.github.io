title: Hack Reactor - Week 3 Day 2
---

Highlights of the day:

* Backbone
* Feedback

### Backbone

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) is a javascript framework that separates concerns into Models, Collections, and Views.  We are just scratching the surface of this as we will hit a full sprint on this tomorrow.  My pair, David Ernst, and I were able to start to work on adapting our current sprint project into a backbone applications.  

This seemed to be a useful way to organize data, information, and rendering of html.  More to come.

### Feedback

One of the things I like about Hack Reactor is that there is a focus on soft skills.  Today we had a session about giving and receiving feedback particularly around pair programming.  I thought it was great that we would even cover this at all.  I love that it will give us all a common language to discuss issues with.  I have always valued communication skills and can definitely see the benefits in tech.
