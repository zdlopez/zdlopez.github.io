# Zachary Lopez's Website

Welcome to my website repo.  On [www.zdlopez.com](www.zdlopez.com), I am posting my thoughts about about software engineering.  Specifically, I am currently documenting my experience at Hack Reactor as a member of cohort 23 (December 2014 to March 2015).

# Theme

The website is thme is Lanyon and the following information is from its creator *Mark Otto*.

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
