# Zachary Lopez's Website

Welcome to my website repo.  On [www.zdlopez.com](www.zdlopez.com), I am posting my thoughts about about software engineering.

Specifically, I was documenting my experience at Hack Reactor as a member of cohort 23 (December 2014 to March 2015).

Every now and then, I post about my learnings in the startup realm.
