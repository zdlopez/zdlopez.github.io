title: About
---

I am a software engineer focused on providing solutions.  I believe that software and technology allows me to have a wider impact on the world.

I just recently graduated from Hack Reactor Cohort 23 in March, 2015.  I have a Computer Science and Computer Engineering BS from [UC Davis](http://ucdavis.edu) in 2004.

In this blog I enjoy writing about tech, algorithms, and other things that interest me. 

Previously, I spent the last 10 years working in the affordable housing industry, specifically in property management.  This work allowed me to give directly back to my community.  I am so grateful for the opportunity and for the many wonderful colleagues that I had the pleasure of working with.

Here are the companies that I have worked for:

* [SAHA](http://www.sahahomes.org)
* [TNDC](http://www.tndc.org)
* [Eden Housing](http://www.edenhousing.org)
