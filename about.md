Currently a student at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com).  I am a member of cohort 23 that began on December 8th, 2014, and concludes on March 14, 2015.  

Previously, I spent the last 10 years working in the affordable housing industry, specifically in property management.  

Here are the companies that I have worked for:

* [SAHA](http://www.sahahomes.org)
* [TNDC](http://www.tndc.org)

I graduated from [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu) in 2004 with a BS in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
