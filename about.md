title: About
---

I am a software engineer focused on providing solutions.  I believe that software and technology allows me to have a wider impact on the world.

Beginning in January 2018, I joined the merchant team at [Postmates](http://www.postmates.com).  I'm excited about the problem space that we work on and interested in seeing how teams work when total engineers > 100.

Prio to Postmates, I worked at [FiveStars](http://www.fivestars.com).  The culture, environment, and people are just what I was looking for as I made my career change away from non-profits.

I graduated from Hack Reactor Cohort 23 in March, 2015.  I have a Computer Science and Computer Engineering BS from [UC Davis](http://ucdavis.edu) in 2004.

In this blog I enjoy writing about tech, algorithms, and other things that interest me. 

Previously, I spent the last 10 years working in the affordable housing industry, specifically in property management.  This work allowed me to give directly back to my community.  I am so grateful for the opportunity and for the many wonderful colleagues that I had the pleasure of working with.
